If you are just getting started in Github, then please complete the following steps in todays session.

1) **Create a repository** (repo) called Data_Portfolio (*avoid spaces in folder or file names especially*)
2) **Upload an R file to your repo** from your computer 
    - **Click Add file or +** (to the left of the *<> Code* button) -> **Upload file** -> **Choose Files**
    - Under *Commit Changes*, where it says "Add files via upload", **add a comment** that says *Uploaded R file*
    - **Click Commit Changes** button at bottom of screen
3) **Create a README file** for your repository that has 
    - a **heading** in markdown, 
    - a **description** explaining that this is your data portfolio, which will include various projects you have completed in data analysis (you can change this description later)
    - **a bulleted list** of all of the tools you have learned so far in the bootcamp.
